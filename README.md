# HerdImmunity2

Herd Immunity Simulation
Description
We're going to create a basic simulation of herd immunity by modeling how a virus moves through a population where some (but not all) of a population is vaccinated against this virus.

Learning Outcomes
By completing this project, you should be able toâ€¦

Applying functions, scope, conditionals, loops, lists, OOP, and file I/O
Practice reading spec, code comments, and starter code
Practice writing basic tests and running them
Basic Structure
The program consists of 4 classes: Person, Virus, Simulation, and FileWriter.

Simulation: The main class that runs the entire simulation.
Person: Represents the people that make up the population that the virus is spreading through.
Virus: Models the properties of the virus we wish to simulate.
FileWriter: A helper class for writing the results of the simulation.
